# React TypeScript Boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for developing React applications in TypeScript, including:
- TypeScript
- React & React DOM
- Webpack
- CSS Modules / SCSS
- TS Node
- Express
- JSDOM
- Mocha
- Chai
- Sinon
- Enzyme
- TSLint
- Prettier

#### Scripts

- `start`: Starts an express server for mocking API responses
- `dev`: Bundles the react app and serves over webpack dev server on 8080
- `build`: Bundles the react app and exports to `dist`
- `types:scss`: Generates static typing for SCSS imports
- `types:scss:watch`: As above, but watches for file changes
- `test`: Runs unit tests
